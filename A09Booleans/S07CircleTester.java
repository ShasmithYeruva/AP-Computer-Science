/* TODO: 07
This program is incorrectly comparing Circles using ==.

Modify the CircleTester class to correctly compare Circle objects 
using .equals

Youï¿½ll need to implement the following methods in the Circle class 
so that the CircleTester can correctly compare and print Circles:

public String toString()
public boolean equals(Circle other)

equals should only return true if both Circles have the exact same 
attributes (color, radius, x, and y). toString should return a 
String of the form 
[color] circle with a radius of [radius] at position ([x], [y]).

For example:

Circle circle = new Circle(10, "blue", 50, 40);
System.out.println(circle);
Should print out

blue circle with a radius of 10 at position (50, 40)

		S07Circle three = new S07Circle(20, "red", 0, 0);
		S07Circle four = three;
