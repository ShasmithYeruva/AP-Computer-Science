/* TODO: 02
An ad agency is interested in keeping track of their clients a little more 
easily.

Help them out by creating two ArrayLists:

Create an ArrayList called companyName that stores an ArrayList of all the 
company names.

Create an Integer ArrayList called contractValue that stores the value of the 
contract that the ad agency has with its clients.
